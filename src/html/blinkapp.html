              ABOUT BLINK ANDROID APP
            </p>
            <p class="lede">
              The Blink Android app had always been lacking behind it's iOS counterpart. So while interning for Blink in the summer of 2017, I helped with an almost complete re-write of the app.
              <br/>
              I also had the chance to work with Blink's internal APIs and understand how the system operated, allowing me to make a dashboard presenting valuable information on top of my cubicle for everyone to see.

              This was my first internship and my first introduction to software engineering in a corporate environment.
              <br/>
              Over the summer, I gained a lot of experience with Android development. Previously I had only worked on Android apps as a hobby.
